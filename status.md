## Notes
- Worker loop runs inside `noetic-mirror-web` (`SERVICE_ROLE=all`, `WORKER_HTTP_ENABLED=false`).
- Local Playwright E2E now passes after pre-creating `.playwright-artifacts-*` directories.
- Prior prod E2E failures were caused by missing valid initData and local disk space (ENOSPC).
- Open questions tracked in open_questions.md.
