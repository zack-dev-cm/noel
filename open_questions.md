# Open Questions

- Which languages beyond RU are in scope for the initial experiment phase (if any)?
- Does "RU as primary" mean a global default for all users, or an RU-locale default with EN still primary?
- Should Researcher and Subject always share the same interaction language, or can they diverge?
- In agent-native mode, should raw outputs be stored, and who can access them?
- What defines "experiment quality" for cross-language comparison (metrics and thresholds)?
- Which Telegram user IDs should be allowed in `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS` for the admin token-saver page?
- Confirm the exact Gemini 3.x model ID available in your GCP project to avoid fallback (current default is `gemini-3.0-pro`).
