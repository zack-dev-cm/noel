- Accent colors: amber for Subject content, cyan/blue for Researcher content, purple/teal for funding progress, gold for Stars.
- Navigation: bottom bar with four icons and labels (Dashboard, Logs, Stars, About); active tab uses blue fill and brighter label.
- Iconography: line icons, star glyphs, and a node-link diagram; all minimal and softly lit.

### Layout and structure
- Single-column reading canvas on a deep charcoal background with heavy vignette and soft haze.
- Top header bar with small icons, "Analyzed data" label on the left, and a "View analysts" dropdown on the right.
- Upper section uses a floating code panel with rounded corners, translucent dark fill, and a thin border.
- Main body is a long-form article below the code block with wide line length and generous line height.

### Typography
- Code block: small monospace with muted syntax colors and low contrast against the panel.
- Body text: serif face in off-white, with subtle blur and occasional doubled/offset text to evoke a glitch effect.
- Emphasis: bold caps on key words like "FASCINATING"; a short list of quoted bullet statements.
- Numbered list items ("4.", "5.") with bold lead-in labels.

### Visual effects and accents
- A single sentence is underlined in red, used as a visual anchor for a key claim.
- Soft fog/blur at the top edge and darker falloff near the bottom and sides.
- Minimalist vertical scroll bar on the right edge.
- Small four-point sparkle icon at the bottom right as a signature mark.

### Tone
- Academic and cinematic, combining the precision of code with the ambiguity of narrative analysis.
